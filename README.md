This project is a modern implementation of The Colossal Adventure Game, a text-based exploration game where players navigate through locations using directional commands to uncover treasures and earn points. The program handles free-form text input, extracting directional intent, and guides players through a dynamic map based on provided .txt files for locations and directions. Players can explore, navigate back and forth, and ultimately find the treasure or encounter dead ends. The implementation features structured logging via ConsoleLogger and FileLogger, ensuring consistent output to both the console and a log file. Adherence to functional and non-functional requirements, such as Java coding conventions, efficient execution, and proper resource management, ensures robustness and alignment with the original gameâ€™s spirit.  

This software was written as a solution to an assignment given in the Object-Oriented Programmiing course at the University of Birmingham.
